Step 1: Prerequisites

  Ensure that you have a MySQL database server installed and running on your system. You can use tools like phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench for database management.

Step 2: Database Creation

  Log in to your MySQL database server using your preferred MySQL client.
  Create a new database for your website using the following SQL command:

    CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;

  Replace your_database_name with the desired name for your database.

Step 3: Table Creation

  After creating the database, switch to the newly created database using the following command:

    USE your_database_name;

  Replace your_database_name with the name of your database.
  Create tables required for your website. You can use the provided SQL script or manually create tables based on your website's requirements.

Step 4: Inserting Data

("just Copy and paste the whole sql code in database.sql")
  Once the tables are created, you can insert sample data to populate your database. You can either manually insert data or use the provided SQL script.

    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

  or simply copy paste the given sql codes in "database.sql"

Step 5: Verifying Data

Verify that the data has been successfully inserted into the tables by running select queries.

  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

Step 6: Database Configuration

  Update your website's configuration file with the database connection details, including hostname, database name, username, and password.

    $hostname = 'localhost'; // or your database server hostname
    $username = 'your_username';("root")
    $password = 'your_password';("")
    $database = 'your_database_name';("CareerPlus")
